# nex
like *No EXplorer*  
This completely random project is for people who would like to try working without explorer on their *windows* pc.  
Nex works quite simply.  
You simply run it instead of explorer at startup.  
After starting, nex will start checking every 10s if cmd.exe is running, if not, it will turn it on.  
*Because you can't turn on any app without explorer.*  
But before that, it looks for **batchrc.bat** in **C:\\Users\\[username]\\** and runs it instead of regular cmd.  
  
enjoy :]
